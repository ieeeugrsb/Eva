# save it as text file with tab separated cells and start tragesym						
						
[options]						
# wordswap swaps labels if the pin is on the right side an looks like this:						
"#   ""PB1 (CLK)"". That's useful for micro controller port labels"						
# rotate_labels rotates the pintext of top and bottom pins						
#   this is useful for large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100 pins						
# sort_labels will sort the pins by it's labels						
#   useful for address ports, busses, ...

[pins]						
# tabseparated list of pin descriptions						
#						
# pinnr is the physical number of the pin						
# seq is the pinseq= attribute, leave it blank if it doesn't matter						
# type can be (in, out, io, oc, oe, pas, tp, tri, clk, pwr)						
# style can be (line,dot,clk,dotclk,none). none if only want to add a net						
# posit. can be (l,r,t,b) or empty for nets						
# net specifies the name of the net. Vcc or GND for example.						
# label represents the pinlabel.						
#	"negation lines can be added with ""\_"" example: \_enable\_ "					
#	"if you want to write a ""\"" use ""\\"" as escape sequence"
