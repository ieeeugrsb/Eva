Instructions to visualize the Data from the Serial Port.
########################################################

Edit Python script with you Serial Port. Something like this: 

port = "/dev/ttyACMX" 

run the script 
	
### ./read_serial.py 

A new file will be created. Roll.txt where the data captured from the serial 
will be stored. To visualize the data run in terminal

###  gnuplot liveplot.gnu

Note1: the data shown in the active window will only be refreshed if a key is 
pushed, so just push the "a" keyboard key.

Note2: Sometime the serial port gives weird characters, if the data is going to 
be processed it is better to look into the first lines if something is weird.
